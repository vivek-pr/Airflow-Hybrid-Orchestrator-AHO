# Airflow-Hybrid-Orchestrator-AHO-
The Airflow Hybrid Orchestrator (AHO) is a distributed workflow orchestration platform built with Apache Airflow 3.0, leveraging a robust control plane/data plane split. It enables scalable, secure, and production-ready workflow automation across cloud, hybrid, and on-premises environments. Workflows are centrally managed and monitored via a secure control plane, while execution is handled by distributed data plane workers, supporting modern hybrid and multi-environment data pipelines.
